# Notification System

Signal-driven notification architecture where producers emit free-form events and an LLM-backed decision engine determines whether, where, and how to notify the user.

## Lifecycle

```
Producer → NotificationSignal → Source-Active Gate → Candidate Generation → Decision Engine (LLM) → Deterministic Checks → Broadcaster → Conversation Pairing → Adapters → Delivery
                                                              ↑                                                            ↓
                                                      Preference Summary                                    notification_conversation_created SSE event
                                                      Conversation Candidates                               (creation-only — not emitted on reuse)
```

### 1. Signal

A producer calls `emitNotificationSignal()` with a free-form event name, attention hints (urgency, requiresAction, deadlineAt), and a context payload. The signal is persisted as a `notification_events` row.

Producers with changeable evidence may supply `isStillCurrent`, an asynchronous
source recheck after composition and deterministic checks, and immediately
before each channel adapter send. False suppresses the stale event and releases
its dedupe claim only when no channel has already accepted or is sending it;
exceptions fail closed through the pipeline's retry-safe failure handling.
Credential alerts recheck the exact provider account and failure state through
the credential-health service. The Telegram adapter also forwards this in-process
guard to every text chunk's API call. Each attempt rechecks after backoff and
before fetching; stale evidence or recheck failure stops the retry loop. Other
adapters need their own retry-time validation. This guard does not provide
exactly-once delivery when a transport response is ambiguous, and partial
multi-chunk delivery still requires reconciliation.

Immediately after persistence, a **source-active pre-gate** runs (`checkSourceActiveSuppression`): when `visibleInSourceNow` is set, a hard signal-only invariant the decision engine cannot override, the signal is suppressed and short-circuits here, before candidate generation and the LLM decision. This keeps an always-suppressed signal (e.g. trusted-contact `verification_sent`) from spending an LLM inference whose result would be discarded. The `notification_events` row is still written for the audit trail.

The hint is not a static `false` for every producer. A conversation-scoped producer derives it per signal through `resolveVisibleInSourceNow()` in `resolve-visible-in-source.ts`, so the same producer suppresses or notifies depending on what the user has on screen. The bar for deriving it rather than passing `false` is high; see [Choosing `visibleInSourceNow`](#choosing-visibleinsourcenow).

### 2. Candidate Generation

Before the decision engine runs, the system builds a **conversation candidate set** per channel (`conversation-candidates.ts`). This is a compact snapshot of recent notification-sourced conversations that the decision engine can choose to reuse instead of starting a new conversation.

**How candidates are generated:**

- For each selected channel, the system queries `notification_deliveries` joined with `notification_decisions` and `notification_events` to find conversations that were created by the notification pipeline within the last 24 hours.
- Up to 5 candidates per channel are returned, deduplicated by conversation ID, most-recent first.
- Each candidate includes: `conversationId`, `title`, `updatedAt`, `latestSourceEventName`, and `channel`.
- **Guardian context enrichment**: When candidates exist, a batch query counts pending (unresolved) guardian approval requests per conversation. Candidates with `pendingUnresolvedRequestCount > 0` carry a `guardianContext` field so the LLM can make informed reuse decisions for conversations with active guardian questions.
- **Candidate-affinity hints**: Guardian dispatch (`guardian-dispatch.ts`) includes `activeGuardianRequestCount` in the signal's `contextPayload`. When multiple guardian questions arise in the same call session, this hint nudges the decision engine toward reusing the existing conversation rather than creating a new one for each question.

The candidate set is serialized into a compact `<conversation-candidates>` block in the decision engine's system prompt. Candidate generation is wrapped in try/catch — a failure does not block the decision path; the engine simply proceeds without candidates (all channels default to `start_new`).

### 3. Decision

For assistant-authored notifications without explicit channel preferences,
`notifications.defaultChannels` selects the deployment's default destinations.
An empty list preserves the standard internal-inbox default. A configured
destination with no available channel fails visibly instead of falling back to
internal-only delivery. Explicit channel preferences retain their existing semantics.

The decision engine (`decision-engine.ts`) sends the signal to an LLM (configured via `llm.callSites.notificationDecision`) along with available channels, the user's preference summary, and the conversation candidate set. The LLM responds with a structured decision: whether to notify, which channels, rendered copy per channel, a deduplication key, and **per-channel conversation actions**.

**Conversation actions:** For each selected channel, the LLM decides:

- `start_new` — create a fresh conversation for this delivery.
- `reuse_existing` — append to an existing candidate conversation (must provide a `conversationId` from the candidate set).

The LLM is guided to prefer `reuse_existing` when the signal is a continuation or update of an existing notification conversation (same event type, related context), and `start_new` when the signal is a distinct event deserving its own conversation.

**Validation and fallback:** Conversation actions are strictly validated against the candidate set (`validateConversationActions` in `decision-engine.ts`):

- A `reuse_existing` action with an empty or missing `conversationId` is downgraded to `start_new` with a warning.
- A `reuse_existing` action referencing a conversation ID not in the candidate set is downgraded to `start_new` with a warning.
- Unknown action values are silently ignored; the channel defaults to `start_new` downstream.
- Channels with no conversation action in the decision output default to `start_new`.

When the LLM is unavailable or returns invalid output, a deterministic fallback fires: high-urgency + requires-action signals notify on all channels; everything else is suppressed. The fallback path does not produce conversation actions (all channels use `start_new`).

### 4. Deterministic Checks

Hard invariants that the LLM cannot override:

**Post-generation enforcement** (`decision-engine.ts`):

- **Reply mechanics never ride in copy**: `stripReplyMechanics()` removes request-code reply instructions the model wrote into any channel's `guardian.question` or `ingress.access_request` copy, as whole sentences (`Reference code: X`, `Reply "X approve"`, a paraphrase or negation of either, `Reply "X trust"`, `Use reference code X`). The mechanics live in exactly one place, the broadcaster's `plainTextFallback` (`buildGuardianRequestCodeInstruction` for questions and approvals, `buildAccessRequestReplyMechanics` for access requests), and a transport appends it only when it sends text without buttons: a rich delivery that failed, or a request with no actions to draw (an option-less voice question, or a coded question that failed strict parsing). The bell, the banner, the push, and every card with buttons therefore show the ask alone. The access-request invite-flow directive is context, not mechanics: no surface has a button for it, so it stays in `buildAccessRequestContextText` on every surface and is ensured into model-composed copy that leaves it out (`ensureAccessRequestInviteDirectiveInCopy`).

**Pre-send gate checks** (`deterministic-checks.ts`) — these all depend on the decision, so they run here, after it:

- **Schema validity** -- fail-closed if the decision is malformed
- **Channel availability** -- at least one selected channel must be connected
- **Deduplication** -- same `dedupeKey` within the dedupe window (1 hour default) is suppressed
- **Rendered copy quality** -- fail-closed on empty copy or a fallback leak (body equal to the raw event name)

Source-active suppression depends only on the signal, so it runs earlier — as the pre-decision gate in `emit-signal.ts` (see step 1), not as a pre-send check here.

### 5. Dispatch

`runtime-dispatch.ts` handles two early-exit cases (shouldNotify=false, no channels), then delegates to the broadcaster.

### 6. Broadcast, Conversation Pairing, and Delivery

The broadcaster (`broadcaster.ts`) iterates over selected channels (vellum first for fast SSE push), resolves destinations via `destination-resolver.ts`, pairs each delivery with a conversation via `conversation-pairing.ts`, pulls rendered copy from the decision (falling back to `copy-composer.ts` templates), and dispatches through channel adapters. Each delivery attempt is recorded in `notification_deliveries` with `conversation_id`, `message_id`, and `conversation_strategy` columns. The broadcaster emits `notification_conversation_created` SSE events for new vellum conversations.

## Channel Policy Registry

`../channels/config.ts` is the **single source of truth** for per-channel notification behavior. Every `ChannelId` must have an entry in the `CHANNEL_POLICIES` map. The TypeScript `satisfies Record<ChannelId, ChannelNotificationPolicy>` constraint ensures that adding a new `ChannelId` to `channels/types.ts` will cause a compile error until a policy entry is added.

Each policy defines:

| Field                               | Type                   | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `notification.deliveryEnabled`      | `boolean`              | Whether the channel can receive notification deliveries           |
| `notification.conversationStrategy` | `ConversationStrategy` | How conversations are materialized for deliveries on this channel |

### Conversation Strategy Types

| Strategy                         | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Used by                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `start_new_conversation`         | Creates a fresh conversation per delivery. The conversation is surfaced via SSE.                                                                                                                                                             | `vellum`                                 |
| `continue_existing_conversation` | Looks up a previously bound conversation by binding key (sourceChannel + externalChatId) and appends to it. When no bound conversation exists (first delivery to a destination), creates a new one and upserts the binding for future reuse. | `telegram`, `whatsapp`, `slack`, `email` |
| `not_deliverable`                | Channel cannot receive notifications. Pairing returns null IDs.                                                                                                                                                                              | `phone`                                  |

### Helper Functions

- `getDeliverableChannels()` -- returns all `ChannelId` values where `deliveryEnabled` is true
- `getChannelPolicy(channelId)` -- returns the full policy object for a channel
- `isNotificationDeliverable(channelId)` -- boolean check for delivery eligibility
- `getConversationStrategy(channelId)` -- returns the conversation strategy for a channel

### How to Add a New Channel

1. Add the channel to `CHANNEL_IDS` in `channels/types.ts`.
2. Add a policy entry in `CHANNEL_POLICIES` in `channels/config.ts`. The compiler will enforce this.
3. If `deliveryEnabled: true`, add an adapter in `adapters/` and register it in `emit-signal.ts` `getBroadcaster()`.
4. Add a connectivity check in `getConnectedChannels()` in `emit-signal.ts`.
5. Add a destination resolver case in `destination-resolver.ts`.

## Conversation Pairing Invariant

**Every notification delivery gets a conversation.** Before the adapter sends a notification, `pairDeliveryWithConversation()` (in `conversation-pairing.ts`) materializes a conversation and seed message based on the channel's conversation strategy and the decision engine's per-channel conversation action:

### Conversation Reuse Path (`reuse_existing`)

When the decision engine selects `reuse_existing` for a channel with a valid candidate `conversationId`:

1. The pairing function looks up the target conversation.
2. If the conversation exists and has `source: 'notification'`, the seed message is **appended** to the existing conversation (not a new one). The result has `createdNewConversation: false`.
3. If the target is invalid (does not exist, or has a different `source`), the function falls back to creating a new conversation and sets `conversationFallbackUsed: true` on the result. A warning is logged with the invalid target details.

### New Conversation Path (`start_new` / default)

- **`start_new_conversation`**: Creates a new conversation with `conversationType: 'standard'` and `source: 'notification'`, plus an assistant message containing the conversation seed. Memory indexing is skipped on the seed message to prevent notification copy from polluting conversational recall. The result has `createdNewConversation: true`.
- **`continue_existing_conversation`**: Looks up a previously bound conversation by binding key (`sourceChannel` + `externalChatId` via `getBindingByChannelChat()`). When a valid bound conversation with `source: 'notification'` exists, the seed message is appended to it and the binding timestamp is refreshed. When no binding exists or the bound conversation is stale/invalid, a new conversation is created and the binding is upserted for future reuse. The result has `createdNewConversation: false` on reuse, `true` on fresh creation.
- **`not_deliverable`**: Returns `{ conversationId: null, messageId: null }`.

The pairing function is resilient -- errors are caught and logged. A pairing failure never breaks the delivery pipeline.

## Multi-Surface Copy Architecture

The system produces **three distinct copy outputs** per notification:

| Output                    | Purpose                                          | Verbosity                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `title` + `body`          | Native notification popup (macOS banner)         | Short and glanceable     |
| `deliveryText`            | Channel-native chat message text (Telegram)      | Natural chat phrasing    |
| Conversation seed message | Opening message in the notification conversation | Richer and context-aware |

### How It Works

1. The **decision engine** can produce `title`/`body` (popup copy), `deliveryText` (chat copy), and `conversationSeedMessage` (richer conversation content) per channel.
2. **Adapters** use the surface-appropriate field:
   - Vellum/macOS notifications use `title` + `body`.
   - Telegram delivery prefers `deliveryText` and falls back to `conversationSeedMessage`, then `body`, then `title`.
3. **Conversation pairing** uses the conversation seed as the conversation's opening message:
   - If the LLM produced a valid `conversationSeedMessage`, it is used directly (after a sanity check rejects empty, too-short, JSON dumps, or excessively long values).
   - Otherwise, the **runtime conversation seed composer** (`conversation-seed-composer.ts`) generates a deterministic, surface-aware seed.

### Surface-Aware Verbosity

The conversation seed composer adapts verbosity to the delivery surface:

| Channel    | Default Interface | Verbosity | Style                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `vellum`   | `macos`           | Rich      | 2-4 short sentences with context and next step |
| `telegram` | `telegram`        | Compact   | 1-2 concise sentences                          |

Interface inference strategy:

1. Explicit `interfaceHint` in the signal's `contextPayload` (if valid `InterfaceId`).
2. `sourceInterface` from the originating conversation (if valid `InterfaceId`).
3. Channel default mapping (`vellum` → `macos` → rich, `telegram` → `telegram` → compact).

### Example: Reminder Notification

**Native popup (vellum/macos):**

```
Title: Reminder
Body:  Take out the trash
```

**Telegram chat delivery (`deliveryText`):**

```
Take out the trash
```

**Conversation seed on vellum/macos (rich):**

```
Reminder. Take out the trash. Action required.
```

## Conversation Surfacing via `notification_conversation_created` Event (Creation-Only)

The `notification_conversation_created` SSE event is emitted **only when a brand-new conversation is actually created** by the broadcaster. Reused conversations do not trigger this event — the macOS client already knows about the conversation from the original creation.

This is enforced in `broadcaster.ts` by gating the event emission on `pairing.createdNewConversation === true`:

```ts
// Emit notification_conversation_created only when a NEW conversation was
// actually created. Reusing an existing conversation should not fire the SSE
// event — the client already knows about the conversation.
if (
  pairing.createdNewConversation &&
  pairing.strategy === "start_new_conversation"
) {
  // ... emit SSE event
}
```

When a vellum notification conversation **is** newly created (strategy `start_new_conversation`), the broadcaster emits the SSE event **immediately**, before waiting for slower channel deliveries (e.g. Telegram). This avoids a race where a slow Telegram delivery delays the broadcast past the macOS deep-link retry window.

The SSE event payload:

```ts
{
  type: 'notification_conversation_created',
  conversationId: string,
  title: string,
  sourceEventName: string,
}
```

The macOS client listens for this event and surfaces the conversation in the sidebar, enabling deep-link navigation to the notification conversation.

### Per-Dispatch Conversation Callback

`emitNotificationSignal()` accepts an optional `onConversationCreated` callback (`options.onConversationCreated`). This lets producers run domain side effects (for example, creating cross-channel guardian delivery rows) as soon as vellum pairing occurs, without introducing a second conversation-creation path.

**Important distinction between the two callbacks:**

- **Per-dispatch `options.onConversationCreated`**: Fires for **both** new and reused vellum conversation pairings. Callers like `dispatchGuardianQuestion` rely on this to create delivery bookkeeping rows before `emitNotificationSignal()` returns, regardless of whether the conversation was newly created or reused.
- **Class-level `this.onConversationCreated` (SSE broadcast)**: Fires **only** when a brand-new conversation is created (`createdNewConversation === true && strategy === 'start_new_conversation'`). This emits the `notification_conversation_created` SSE event so macOS clients surface the new conversation in the sidebar. Reused conversations do not trigger this event because the client already knows about the conversation.

## Schedule Routing Metadata and Trigger-Time Enforcement

Schedules (both recurring and one-shot) carry optional routing metadata that controls how notifications fan out across channels when the schedule fires in `notify` mode. This enables a single schedule to produce multi-channel delivery without requiring the user to create duplicate schedules per channel.

### Routing Intent Model

The `routing_intent` field on each `schedule_jobs` row specifies the desired channel coverage:

| Intent           | Behavior                                                                    | When to use                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `single_channel` | Caps delivery to one connected channel, honoring explicit preferences first | Schedules requested on one particular channel                |
| `multi_channel`  | Ensures delivery on 2+ channels when 2+ are connected                       | Important schedules the user wants on both desktop and phone |
| `all_channels`   | Forces delivery on every connected channel                                  | Critical schedules that must reach the user everywhere       |

The default is `all_channels`. Routing intent is persisted in the `schedule_jobs` table (`routing_intent` column) and carried through the notification signal as `routingIntent`.

### Routing Hints

The `routing_hints_json` field is free-form JSON metadata passed alongside the routing intent. It flows through the signal as `routingHints` and is included in the decision engine prompt, allowing producers to communicate channel preferences or contextual hints without requiring schema changes.

For `single_channel`, `preferred_channels` (or the compatible `preferredChannels` spelling) selects the first connected channel in that list before falling back to the source channel and then the decision's first selected channel. This preserves the requested destination when urgency adds internal notification surfaces.

### Trigger-Time Enforcement Flow

When a schedule fires in `notify` mode, the routing metadata flows through the notification pipeline with a post-decision enforcement step:

```
Schedule fires (scheduler.ts: notify mode)
  → notifyScheduleOneShot callback (lifecycle.ts)
    → emitNotificationSignal({ routingIntent, routingHints })
      → Decision Engine (LLM selects channels)
        → enforceRoutingIntent() (post-decision guard)
          → Deterministic Checks
            → Broadcaster → Adapters → Delivery
```

The `enforceRoutingIntent()` function in `decision-engine.ts` runs after the LLM produces its channel selection but before deterministic checks. It overrides the decision's `selectedChannels` based on the routing intent:

- **`all_channels`**: Replaces `selectedChannels` with all connected channels (from `getConnectedChannels()`).
- **`multi_channel`**: If the LLM selected fewer than 2 channels but 2+ are connected, expands `selectedChannels` to at least two connected channels.
- **`single_channel`**: No override -- the LLM's selection stands.

When enforcement changes the decision, the updated channel selection is re-persisted to the `notification_decisions` table so the stored decision matches what was actually dispatched. The `reasoningSummary` is annotated with the enforcement action (e.g. `[routing_intent=all_channels enforced: vellum, telegram]`).

### Single-Schedule Fanout

A key design principle: **one schedule produces one notification signal that fans out to multiple channels**. The user never needs to create separate schedules for each channel. The routing intent metadata on the single schedule controls the fanout behavior, and the notification pipeline handles per-channel copy rendering, conversation pairing, and delivery through the existing adapter infrastructure.

### Data Flow

```
schedule_jobs table (routing_intent, routing_hints_json)
  → scheduler.ts: claimDueSchedules() reads routing metadata
    → lifecycle.ts: notifyScheduleOneShot({ routingIntent, routingHints })
      → emitNotificationSignal({ routingIntent, routingHints })
        → signal.ts: NotificationSignal.routingIntent / routingHints
          → decision-engine.ts: evaluateSignal() → enforceRoutingIntent()
            → broadcaster.ts: fan-out to selected channel adapters
```

## Channel Delivery Architecture

The notification system delivers to three channel types:

### Vellum (always connected)

Local SSE via the assistant's broadcast mechanism. The `VellumAdapter` emits a `notification_intent` message containing:

- `sourceEventName` -- the event that triggered the notification
- `title` and `body` -- rendered notification copy
- `deepLinkMetadata` -- optional metadata for navigating to the relevant context (e.g. `{ conversationId }`)

The macOS client posts a native `UNUserNotificationCenter` notification from this payload. When the user taps the notification, the client uses `deepLinkMetadata` to navigate to the relevant conversation.

### Telegram (when guardian binding exists)

HTTP POST to the gateway's `/deliver/telegram` endpoint. The `TelegramAdapter` sends channel-native text (`deliveryText` when present) to the guardian's chat ID (resolved from the active guardian binding), with deterministic fallbacks when model copy is unavailable.

### Channel Connectivity

Connected channels are resolved at signal emission time by `getConnectedChannels()` in `emit-signal.ts`:

- **Vellum** is always considered connected (HTTP transport is always available when the assistant is running)
- **Telegram** is considered connected only when an active guardian binding exists for the assistant (checked via `getActiveBinding()`)

## Conversation Materialization

The system uses a single conversation materialization path for **all** notifications -- there are no legacy bypass paths or dual-broadcast mechanisms. Every notification, including guardian questions and access-request alerts, flows through `emitNotificationSignal()`:

1. `emitNotificationSignal()` evaluates the signal and dispatches to channels.
2. `NotificationBroadcaster` pairs each delivery with a conversation via `pairDeliveryWithConversation()`, executing the per-channel conversation action (start_new or reuse_existing).
3. For vellum deliveries, the broadcaster merges `conversationId` into `deepLinkMetadata` and emits `notification_conversation_created` only when a new conversation was created (not on reuse).

Guardian dispatch follows this same path and uses the optional `onConversationCreated` callback to attach guardian-delivery bookkeeping to the paired vellum conversation.

### Conversation Pairing Invariant

For notification flows that create conversations, the conversation must be created **before** the SSE event is emitted. This ensures the macOS client can immediately fetch the conversation contents when it receives the conversation-created event.

## Conversation Decision Audit Trail

Every conversation routing decision is persisted for observability:

### Decision-Level Audit (`notification_decisions`)

When the decision is persisted, a `conversationActions` summary is included in `validationResults`:

```json
{
  "conversationActions": {
    "vellum": "start_new",
    "telegram": "reuse:conv-abc-123"
  }
}
```

### Delivery-Level Audit (`notification_deliveries`)

Three columns on `notification_deliveries` record the per-channel conversation decision:

| Column                       | Type    | Description                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conversation_action`        | TEXT    | `'start_new'` or `'reuse_existing'` — what the model decided                                                |
| `conversation_target_id`     | TEXT    | The candidate `conversationId` when action is `reuse_existing`                                              |
| `conversation_fallback_used` | INTEGER | `1` if `reuse_existing` was attempted but the target was invalid, so a new conversation was created instead |

### Query Examples

```sql
-- Conversation reuse decisions with fallback tracking
SELECT d.channel, d.conversation_action, d.conversation_target_id,
       d.conversation_fallback_used, d.conversation_id
FROM notification_deliveries d
WHERE d.conversation_action IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Reuse failures (model hallucinated an invalid conversation ID)
SELECT d.channel, d.conversation_target_id, d.conversation_id
FROM notification_deliveries d
WHERE d.conversation_fallback_used = 1
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;
```

## Guardian Multi-Request Disambiguation in Reused Conversations

When the decision engine routes multiple guardian questions to the **same** conversation (via `reuse_existing`), those questions share a single conversation. The guardian needs a way to indicate which question they are answering. This is handled via **request-code disambiguation**.

### How Request Codes Work

Each guardian request is assigned a unique 6-character hex code (e.g. `A1B2C3`) at creation time, generated gateway-side during `guardian_requests_create` (`generateRequestCode()` in `gateway/src/db/guardian-request-store.ts`). The guardian sees the code only where they need to type it: in the plain-text fallback a transport appends when it sends a request without buttons, and in the router's disambiguation reply when several requests are pending.

### Disambiguation Flow

The disambiguation logic is identical on all channels — mac/vellum (`conversation-process.ts`) and Telegram (`inbound-message-handler.ts`):

1. **Single pending delivery in the conversation**: The guardian's reply is matched to the sole pending request automatically. No request code prefix is needed. This is the **single-match fast path**.

2. **Multiple pending deliveries in the conversation**: The guardian must prefix their reply with the request code of the question they are answering (e.g. `A1B2C3 yes, allow it`). Matching is case-insensitive.

3. **No code match**: If the guardian's reply does not start with any active request code, a **disambiguation message** is sent back listing all active request codes so the guardian can retry with the correct prefix.

### Channel Parity

The disambiguation invariant is enforced identically across:

- **Mac/Vellum** (`conversation-process.ts`): Intercepts user messages in conversations with pending guardian action deliveries before the agent loop runs.
- **Telegram** (`inbound-message-handler.ts`): Intercepts inbound messages matched to conversations with pending guardian action deliveries.

All three paths use the same pattern: look up pending deliveries by conversation, apply single-match fast path or request-code prefix matching, and send disambiguation messages via the guardian action message composer when ambiguous.

### Disambiguation Message Generation

All disambiguation messages are generated through `composeGuardianActionMessageGenerative()` in `guardian-action-message-composer.ts`, which uses a 2-tier priority chain (LLM generator with deterministic fallback). Three disambiguation scenarios exist:

| Scenario                           | When triggered                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `guardian_disambiguation`          | Multiple pending approval requests in a conversation   |
| `guardian_expired_disambiguation`  | Multiple expired requests with late replies            |
| `guardian_followup_disambiguation` | Multiple follow-up deliveries awaiting guardian action |

## How to Add a New Notification Producer

1. Import `emitNotificationSignal` from `./emit-signal.js`.
2. Call it with the signal parameters:

```ts
import { emitNotificationSignal } from "../notifications/emit-signal.js";

await emitNotificationSignal({
  sourceEventName: "your_event_name",
  sourceChannel: "scheduler", // where the event originated
  sourceContextId: conversationId,
  attentionHints: {
    requiresAction: true,
    urgency: "high",
    isAsyncBackground: false,
    // `false` is the correct default. Only a producer that can prove this
    // arrival already rendered the event in the conversation may resolve the
    // hint instead, and each one needs a flag that names it. See
    // "Choosing `visibleInSourceNow`" below.
    visibleInSourceNow: false,
  },
  contextPayload: {
    /* arbitrary data for the decision engine */
  },
  // Optional: control multi-channel fanout behavior
  routingIntent: "multi_channel", // 'single_channel' | 'multi_channel' | 'all_channels'
  routingHints: { preferredChannels: ["telegram"] },
});
```

3. Optionally add a fallback copy template in `copy-composer.ts` keyed by your `sourceEventName`. Without a template, the generic fallback produces a human-readable version of the event name.

The call is fire-and-forget safe by default -- errors are caught and logged internally unless you pass `throwOnError: true`.

### Choosing `visibleInSourceNow`

Step 1 suppresses on this hint before anything else runs, and nothing downstream can rescue a signal it swallows, so a wrong `true` deletes the notification outright. All four rules below must hold before a producer resolves the hint instead of passing `false`.

- **Opt in only when the notification duplicates something that conversation has already rendered, and only behind a flag that names your producer.** `resolveVisibleInSourceNow()` reads `activity-presence-suppression`, which gates the background-activity failure producer alone, so a new producer needs its own flag or an extension of that one before it calls the resolver. Otherwise the flag silently governs a producer its description does not cover. Having a conversation id in scope is not sufficient; the producer must know that _this_ arrival put the announced thing on screen there. `runtime/background-job-runner.ts` is the worked example: one catch block is reached from several directions, and it passes `presenceConversationId` only when the failure carries a `turnFailure`, the one arrival whose conversation is guaranteed to have emitted a `conversation_error` the user can read. A runner timeout leaves the turn still rendering as in progress and a bootstrap throw never reaches the agent loop, so both keep notifying.
- **Pass a literal `false` for global and infra signals.** Heartbeat, credential health, webhook health, and worker liveness have no source surface to watch, so there is nothing to duplicate.
- **Never opt in a `guardian.question` producer.** The card _is_ the prompt, so a `true` suppresses the question's only rendering and the tool hangs until the prompt timeout. `runtime/question-request-guardian-bridge.ts` carries the rationale at its hint block, and three regression pins hold the line: `runtime/__tests__/question-request-guardian-bridge.test.ts`, `__tests__/confirmation-request-guardian-bridge.test.ts`, and `__tests__/notification-guardian-path.test.ts`.
- **A producer running inside the schedule worker cannot read presence at all.** `schedule/worker.ts` is a standalone OS process and the sole runner of schedule execution, while the resolver reads `assistantEventHub` through `isWebConversationFocused()` and that hub's SSE clients exist only in the assistant process. Every presence read from the worker resolves `false`, whatever the user is watching. The trap is in testing: a test that drives the producer and mocks presence in one process passes while the shipped worker suppresses nothing. Tracked as JARVIS-1711.

## How to Add a New Channel

1. Add the channel to `CHANNEL_IDS` in `channels/types.ts`.
2. Create an adapter in `adapters/` implementing the `ChannelAdapter` interface.
3. Register the adapter in `emit-signal.ts` `getBroadcaster()`.
4. Add a connectivity check in `getConnectedChannels()` in `emit-signal.ts`.
5. Add a destination resolver case in `destination-resolver.ts`.
6. Add the channel to the `NotificationChannel` union in `types.ts`.

## Audit Trail

Three SQLite tables form the audit chain:

- **`notification_events`** -- every signal that entered the pipeline, with attention hints and context payload
- **`notification_decisions`** -- the routing decision for each event (shouldNotify, selectedChannels, reasoning, confidence, whether fallback was used)
- **`notification_deliveries`** -- per-channel delivery attempts with status (pending/sent/failed/skipped), rendered copy, error details, conversation pairing data (`conversation_id`, `message_id`, `conversation_strategy`), and client delivery outcome (`client_delivery_status`, `client_delivery_error`, `client_delivery_at`)

### Client Delivery Ack

For vellum (macOS) deliveries, the audit trail now extends past the SSE broadcast to the actual OS notification post. The `notification_intent` message carries an optional `deliveryId` that the client echoes back in a `notification_intent_result` ack after `UNUserNotificationCenter.add()` completes (or fails).

The ack populates three columns on `notification_deliveries`:

| Column                   | Type    | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `client_delivery_status` | TEXT    | `'delivered'` if the OS accepted the notification, `'client_failed'` otherwise |
| `client_delivery_error`  | TEXT    | Error description when the post failed (e.g. authorization denied)             |
| `client_delivery_at`     | INTEGER | Epoch ms timestamp of when the client reported the outcome                     |

This means the audit trail can now answer three questions for each vellum delivery:

1. **Was the intent broadcast?** -- existing `status` column (`sent`)
2. **Did the client attempt to post?** -- `client_delivery_status` is non-null
3. **Did the OS post succeed or fail, and why?** -- `client_delivery_status` + `client_delivery_error`

Query examples:

```sql
-- Recent decisions that resulted in notifications
SELECT e.source_event_name, d.should_notify, d.selected_channels, d.reasoning_summary
FROM notification_decisions d
JOIN notification_events e ON d.notification_event_id = e.id
WHERE d.should_notify = 1
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Failed deliveries
SELECT d.channel, d.error_message, d.rendered_title
FROM notification_deliveries d
WHERE d.status = 'failed'
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;

-- Deliveries with conversation pairing
SELECT d.channel, d.conversation_id, d.message_id, d.conversation_strategy, d.rendered_title
FROM notification_deliveries d
WHERE d.conversation_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;

-- Vellum deliveries where the client failed to post the notification
SELECT d.rendered_title, d.client_delivery_status, d.client_delivery_error, d.client_delivery_at
FROM notification_deliveries d
WHERE d.channel = 'vellum' AND d.client_delivery_status = 'client_failed'
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;
```

## Conversational Preferences

Users express notification preferences in natural language during conversations (e.g., "Use Telegram for urgent alerts", "Mute notifications after 10pm"). The system:

1. **Detects** preferences via `preference-extractor.ts` -- an LLM call that runs on each user message in `conversation-process.ts`
2. **Stores** them in `notification_preferences` with structured conditions (`appliesWhen`: timeRange, channels, urgencyLevels, contexts) and a priority level (0=default, 1=override, 2=critical)
3. **Summarizes** them at decision time via `preference-summary.ts`, which builds a compact text block injected into the decision engine's system prompt

Preferences are sanitized against prompt injection (angle brackets replaced with harmless unicode equivalents).

## Configuration

The decision engine and preference extractor pick their per-call LLM config
from the unified `llm` block. Override defaults by setting either of:

| Key                                  | Type   | Default   | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `llm.callSites.notificationDecision` | object | _(unset)_ | Provider/model/effort/etc. override for the decision engine call site      |
| `llm.callSites.preferenceExtraction` | object | _(unset)_ | Provider/model/effort/etc. override for the preference extractor call site |

When a call site override is unset, the resolver falls back to the shipped call-site default profile.

The notification pipeline is always active -- signals are processed and dispatched as soon as the assistant is running. The audit trail (events, decisions, deliveries) is written for every signal.
