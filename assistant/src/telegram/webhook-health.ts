/**
 * Telegram webhook health sweep.
 *
 * When the public ingress URL behind the Telegram webhook stops working (dead
 * tunnel, rotated ngrok URL, changed gateway route), Telegram keeps accepting
 * updates and queueing them, and nothing on our side notices: the gateway
 * registers the webhook (`telegram/webhook-manager.ts`) but never re-reads it,
 * so the channel goes dark indefinitely. Telegram itself reports the failure
 * via `getWebhookInfo`; this sweep polls that and tells the guardian.
 *
 * Detection only — the sweep never calls `setWebhook`. Re-registration stays
 * with the gateway reconciler, which already fires on credential change,
 * ingress-config change, and system wake. Auto-repairing from here would fight
 * a user mid-setup, and in the common case (a rotated tunnel URL that config
 * still points at) re-registering would just re-register the same dead URL.
 *
 * ## Why recency, not presence
 *
 * `last_error_date` is documented as "Unix time for the most recent error that
 * happened when trying to deliver an update via webhook"
 * (https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#webhookinfo). Telegram does not document
 * clearing it on recovery, and in practice it persists — so its mere presence
 * is NOT evidence of a current outage. A bot that had one blip last month would
 * alert forever. We therefore treat the webhook as failing only when the most
 * recent error is inside `ERROR_RECENCY_WINDOW_MS`.
 *
 * Known limitation: Telegram only produces delivery errors when it has
 * something to deliver. A dead webhook on a channel with no inbound traffic
 * stops refreshing `last_error_date` and reads as healthy here. That is the
 * benign case — nobody is being dropped — and the first message that does
 * arrive re-arms the error, so the next sweep catches it.
 *
 * ## Why its own timer rather than the heartbeat
 *
 * The credential-health check rides `HeartbeatService.executeRun`, which is
 * gated by active hours, `maxConsecutiveRuns`, and `maxDailyRuns`. Those gates
 * exist to stop burning LLM tokens while the guardian is away, and
 * `maxConsecutiveRuns` resets only when the guardian sends a message. A
 * guardian whose only channel is the broken one can't send that message, so
 * riding the heartbeat would mute this check exactly when it matters most.
 * One unauthenticated-cost HTTP GET has none of that token pressure, so it runs
 * on its own interval alongside the other daemon sweeps.
 *
 * That choice carries an obligation: AGENTS.md ("No LLM Work at Daemon
 * Startup") bars LLM providers from unconditional timers and exempts the
 * heartbeat, and this sweep gave up that exemption. So the alert deliberately
 * takes the decision engine's verbatim pass-through — see notifyWebhookFailure.
 * Anything added here that reaches an LLM has to re-answer that rule.
