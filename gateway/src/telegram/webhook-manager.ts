  // (LUM-2899).
  //
  //   1. Platform pods (`IS_PLATFORM`) with `velay-webhooks` off always use
  //      the managed callback route and never consult ingress at all. A pod's
  //      `ingress.publicBaseUrl` is written by the Velay tunnel client, not by

  //      that resolved through the address alone would be pointed at a dead
  //      one. The platform callback route is the pod's stable inbound address.
  //   2. With the flag on, a pod points Telegram at its published Velay URL
  //      and claims that path in the ingress registry first, so the tunnel
  //      edge and the bridge both admit it. A pod with no published URL, or a
  //      claim that fails, still falls back to the managed callback route.
  //      Both the tunnel publishing a URL and the flag flipping re-run this
  //      reconciliation, so a pod moves between the two addresses in either
  //      direction without a restart.
  //   3. An explicit `ingress.enabled: false` is a decision not to accept
  //      inbound webhooks at all; it precedes both tiers below and actively
  //      deregisters, so `reconcileTelegramWebhook` handles it before calling
  //      this resolver. Platform pods are exempt (see the comment there).
  //   4. A configured public ingress URL wins (a self-hosted tunnel, or the
  //      Velay-published URL while the tunnel is registered).
  //   5. Platform-connected local assistants holding vellum credentials fall
  //      back to a managed platform callback route.

  //      features and credential presence, so a gateway with no platform
